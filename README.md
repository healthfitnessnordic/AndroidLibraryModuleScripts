# AndroidLibraryModuleScripts
Some scripts to use for making library modules in a Android project. The modules will support Hilt.

You can test it out by cloning the project and run `./module.sh $nameOfModule`

By default the modules requires you to use version catalog, but feel free to change up the scrips to cater for your projects way of using dependencies.
